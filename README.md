This is a project to refactor the code for a fictional marketing agency's website to accomplish three aims:
First, they want their website to be search engine optimized, and that requires including semantic code for sections, asides, et cetera.
Second, they want their website to be accessible, and that requires adding image alt text for screen readers.
Third, they want their website's code to be comprehensible, and that requires sensible CSS code sectioned into logical sections.

Therefore, I have refactored their HTML elements into semantic elements, replacing generic <div> tags with more specific ones such as <section>, <aside>, and <nav>.
  I have also assigned descriptive alt text to the website's images, both to increase its SEO searchability and to optimize it for screen reading software.
  Finally, I have refactored the website's CSS to account for the HTML changes made and also to make it more legible for other developers. I have attempted to define its uses through notes that describe the section that each element is affecting on the website.
